# operator-learning-dataset
We share some commonly used dataset in oprator learning research.
The dataset can also be used in some other scientific machine learning tasks.
All code are Juypter notebooks, and you can run them in Jupyter, Google Colab or Kaggle...
To make the code user friendly, each code (file) does NOT rely on any other code, just run the code and the output will be the dataset for you.


Here are the Content page of all codes:

Dynamical system with control:

1. Predatory and prey, filename: pred_prey.ipynb


Parametric PDE:

1. 


The codes and datasets are used in the following papers:
